# Simple text-based definitions of hierarchical ontologies of
# (physical) entity types, relation types, event types, and
# attributes.

# This is a minimal example configuration, based (loosely) on some
# ACE'05 entity, relation and event definitions
# (http://projects.ldc.upenn.edu/ace/annotation/2005Tasks.html).

[relations]

# Definition of (binary) relations.

# Format in brief: one relation per line, with first space-separated
# field giving the relation type and the rest of the line the
# comma-separated arguments in ROLE:TYPE format. The roles are
# typically "Arg1" and "Arg2".

<OVERLAP>          Arg1:<ENTITY>, Arg2:<ENTITY>, <OVL-TYPE>:<ANY>

# family             Arg1:Person, Arg2:Person, <REL-TYPE>:symmetric-transitive
# employment         Arg1:Person, Arg2:Organization|Person



# hasName            Arg1:Person|Organization|Place, Arg2:ProperName
# location           Arg1:Person|Organization, Arg2:Place
# owns			   Arg1:Person, Arg2:Person
# alias              Arg1:Person, Arg2:Person, <REL-TYPE>:symmetric-transitive
# geographical_part  Arg1:Location, Arg2:Location

[events]

# Definition of events.

# Format in brief: one event per line, with first space-separated
# field giving the event type and the rest of the line the
# comma-separated arguments in ROLE:TYPE format. Arguments may be
# specified as either optional (by appending "?" to role) or repeated
# (by appending either "*" for "0 or more" or "+" for "1 or more").

[attributes]

# Definition of entity and event attributes.

# Format in brief: first tab-separated field is attribute name, second
# a set of key-value pairs. The latter must define "Arg:" which
# specifies what the attribute can attach to (typically "<EVENT>").
# If no other keys are defined, the attribute is binary (present or
# absent). If "Value:" with multiple alternatives is defined, the
# attribute can have one of the given values.
# Negation     Arg:<EVENT>
# Confidence   Arg:<EVENT>, Value:High|Neutral|Low
