# Description of the VOC Testaments

The VOC wills in the National Archives are a small part of a much larger collection of wills that ever existed. Every VOC employee was obliged to have a will drawn up (this could be done in Amsterdam, on the ships or in the VOC establishments). This was a form of efficient personnel policy so that after the death of an employee it was clear what should be done with the bequest. 

The collection in which we work is largely built up in the VOC establishments, in particular Batavia. A copy of each will was sent to the VOC headquarters in Amsterdam. After the disintegration of the VOC at the end of the 18th century, part of these copy wills have been preserved and probably only much later merged into volumes (in Dutch: banden) that are now in the custody of the National Archives. In the 19th century, archivists produced an index to these testaments indexing the name of the male testator. A few years ago these testaments were digitized and can be accessed online but the 19th century index was still the main tool to be used to access the wills.  

This project is concerned with [testaments of those employed by the VOC](https://www.nationaalarchief.nl/onderzoeken/zoekhulpen/voc-oost-indische-testamenten) now with the National Archives. These handwritten wills were recorded in Dutch in the XVII and XVIII century. These wills have been recently automatically transcribed using handwritten text recognition (HTR) technology, therefore the transcriptions might contain errors.
