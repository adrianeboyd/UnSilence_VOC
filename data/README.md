# Annotation Typology

To 'unsilence' colonial archives by broadening access, more inclusive finding aids are required, encompassing all persons mentioned in the archive with emphasis on marginalized ones. Existing generic typologies for named entity recognition and classification tasks mainly focus on the high-level 'universal' or 'ubiquitous' triad *Person*, *Organization* and *Location*. **Our custom typology extends the
universal triad to encompass all mentions of entities, both named and unnamed, and further qualifies them by gender, legal status, notarial roles and other relevant attributes**. Our typology is visually illustrated below:

Our custom typology separates the name of an entity (always tagged separately as Proper Name) from a generic reference to an
entity type (Person, Place or Organization). We introduce this distinction primarily because marginalized persons are frequently mentioned in the VOC testaments, and in colonial archives more generally, without name. Instead they are referred to by a variety of terms such as “slaaf” [slave], “leiffeigenen” [serf] and “inlandse burger” [formerly enslaved persons or descendants
of freed slaves].
